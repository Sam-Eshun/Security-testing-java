# Security-testing-Static Analysis for Detecting XSS Vulnerabilities using Schoolmate Web Application
### Security Testing Project, 2015 Fall Semester, Unitn-Trento.
#### Static Analysis of Detecting XSS Vulnerabilities



This is a security testing project using Static Taint Analysis to detect XSS vulnerabilities in a PHP web application [SchoolMate](SchoolMate/https://sourceforge.net/projects/schoolmate/) using the pixy tool.

The following tasks were performed:
* Running of the Pixy tool that detects all the XSS vulnerabilities, among which there are false positives and true positives.
* Security test cases
* Using JWebUnit to write prof-of-concept attacks
* Fixing the vulnerabilities by checking the root causes and describing them
* Finally report on passed and failed test and tainted analysis with fixed code
